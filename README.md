After clicking on new game, you can choose between playing a new game or continue playing a saved game.

The saved games are on a json file, there you just put the name of the player on the input box and click on play to play or delete to delete. You can use next and previous also to travel through the chosen player games.

If you decide to play a new game you choose to play on a 2x2 or a 3x3 board, after that select one of the 3 difficulties (they only change the amount of initial placed numbers) and then you just play ! There is a save button there also if you want to save the game for another moment.
